### Changed

- image lock preempt function

### Removed
- image auto rm

## [1.5.2] - 2017-03-29
### Added

### Changed

## [1.5.1] - 2016-09-20
### Changed
- Update XFS checks to mount/unmount to clear any disk logs

## [1.5.0] - 2016-09-01
### Added
- Updated plugin to include Capabilities() method and new method
  signatures for Mount(MountRequest) and Unmount(UnmountRequest)
- add xfs filesystem check before mount - if xfs-repair -n returns
  error, Mount operation fails with note to manually repair

## [1.4.1] - 2016-08-05
### Changed
- Bug fix from bad upstream merge: provide openContext and
  shutdownContext

## [1.4.0] - 2016-08-05
### Added
- Merged upstream fixes for pull porcupie/rbd-docker-plugin#7

## [1.3.0] - 2016-08-05
### Added
- Added goroutines and timeouts to all shell commands, hoping to prevent
  propagation of hung external procs to docker daemon

## [1.2.2] - 2016-06-08
### Changed
- Docker is calling Unmount after failed Mount, causing trouble if
  device is still in use by another container (locked by same node).
The workaround / hack is to bail earlier in Unmount API call if rbd
unmap fails with busy device error. This can leave the device usable but
possibly in a funky state (unmounted from host but still mounted and
accessible inside container)
- related to porcupie/rbd-docker-plugin#5

## [1.2.1] - 2016-06-02
### Changed
- When rbd map does not return device name but no error, try default
  device path (/dev/rbd/<pool>/<image>). Issue porcupie/rbd-docker-plugin#4

## [1.2.0] - 2016-06-02
### Added
- Updated to pull in yp-engineering/rbd-docker-plugin v0.9.1.2, which
  includes support for Docker Volume Create options: size, pool, fstype

## [1.1.1] - 2016-04-15
### Changed
- Due to issue with golang 1.6 and strict Host header requirements, we
  cannot use golang 1.6 to compile our plugin since docker never sends
  correct Host header for plugin socket usage.
  * Recompiled with golang 1.5

## [1.1.0] - 2016-04-15
### Added
- added a cron job and check script for the Ceph configs and tpkg update

## [1.0.0] - 2016-04-15
### Changed
- bump major version with deprecated --remove boolean flag
- --remove flag now takes one of three values: ignore, delete or rename
  - ignore will just ignore the docker volume Remove call (new default)
  - delete will destroy the rbd volume on Remove request
  - rename will rename the rbd volume on Remove request, prefixed with `zz_`

## [0.5.0] - 2016-04-13
### Changed
- pulled latest from upstream yp-engineering/rbd-docker-plugin
  - add new docker volume api support (Get, List)
  - use ceph/go-ceph instead of noahdesu/go-ceph
  - use docker/go-plugins-helpers/ instead of calavera/dkvolume

## [0.4.2] - 2016-03-16
### Changed
- Update logrotate config to restart instead of reload
### Added 
- Some new marathon-tester configs for running a test container in
  Marathon/Mesos environment

## [0.4.1] - 2015-12-03
### Changed
- Update systemd service unit to add --config /etc/ceph/ceph.conf 
- Force default config file in main.go to /etc/ceph/ceph.conf

## [0.4.0] - 2015-12-03
### Changed
- Last ditch effort : Update all Plugin RBD functions to use CLI shell
  commands instead of go-ceph library
- Provide command line flag --go-ceph to use go-ceph lib, otherwise default
  now is shell CLI command via `rbd` binary

## [0.3.1] - 2015-11-30
### Changed
- Try to open RBD Image without read-only option (no effect)
- Try to use same client-id for every connection -- not possible in
  go-ceph
- Adding --conf options to external rbd operations (was having micro-osd
  issues)

## [0.3.0] - 2015-11-25
### Changed
- Update go-ceph import to use github.com/ceph/go-ceph instead of
  noahdesu/go-ceph
- Recreate ceph connection and pool context for every operation (don't 
  try to cache them)

## [0.2.2] - 2015-11-19
### Changed
- Disable the reload operation in systemd service unit, having issues
  with go-ceph lib and that operation (panics)
